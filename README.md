# Exercise: Selecting Elements in the DOM

Practice your DOM selection skills!

Your task is to select and store three DOM elements in the pre-defined variables mainHeading, secondAdvantage and advDiv:

mainHeading should store the <h1> element

secondAdvantage should store the second (!) <li> element (<li>Available</li>)

advDiv should store the <div> with the id advantages

Use the DOM selection tools you learned about to get access to those elements and store them in the three variables.
